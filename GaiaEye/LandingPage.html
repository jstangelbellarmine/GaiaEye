                    A casuality of the Columbian Exchange, industrialization, and  globalization has been the
                    network of native, robust ecosystems that were once abundand. A growing body of research
                    has shown that some invasive plants, long imported for their agricultural or landscaping allure,
                    have taken over and crowded out native species all across the world. In some parts of Illinois,
                    European Buckthorn accounts for over 50% of the tree cover. That means that HALF of land is
                    being choked out by this single plant.

                    Luckily, a group of dedicated changemakers, through private, public, and individual efforts, has
                    been clawing back the land from this ruthless invader. Through the use of community
                    mobilization, teamwork, and the continuous dedication of thousands of peopole, progress being made.
                    One of the growing issues in the effort, however, is the monitering of restored areas for the return of
                    Buckthorn. With Gaia Eye, conversationists and nature lovers have another tool available to help better
                    deploy resources and manage natural spaces. By harnessing emerging drone and AI technologies, our software
                    has the potential to tip the scales in favor of Gaia herself.
                -->
                    Conservation efforts and AI capibilities have converged to create GaiaEye, a mapping
                    software that provides the boots on the ground with information they need to effectively make
                    sustainable and effecient decisions. With image recognition and geolocational plotting, 
                    conservationists can use GaiaEye's map to better understand their sites and monitor progress.

                    Gaia Eye combines the use of UAV (drone) photography, image recognition, and geolocation data to
                    provide the user with a regularly updated, dynamic map of European Buckthorn in an area. With a simple setup using
                    a DJI drone, GaiaEye takes multiple photos of a given area and analyzes them with our algorithm. When 
                    identified, our software plots each instance on a map that is available to the user.

                <p class="content">
                    A new initiative of <a href="https://www.allamericangardens.org" target="_blank">All-American Gardens</a>, 
                    Gaia Eye will incorporate emerging technologies to assist in the restoration of our green spaces. Our software 
                    can monitor, identify, and inform for more effective stewardship. Founded in 2016, All-American Gardens reintroduced 
                    native species and help strengthen urban ecosystems in Indianapolis' East Side. Through intentional orchard management, 
                    targeted planting, and partnerships with city-wide sustainability experts, our organization has 
                    established two urban prairies, two fruit orchards, and a hazelnut patch. With the development and deployment
                    of Gaia Eye, All-American Gardens can further its impact to branch out of the urban niche and move into
                    the broader world of habitat restoration.
                
                    Gaia Eye's realization is thanks in large part to another public partnership with the Forest Preserves of Cook
                    County. Developed in the field and with the sole permission of the FPCC, our software is field-tested and Mother
                    Nature approved. Special thanks go out to John Balaban, Michael Andrews, and Doctor Sayani Sarkar, without whose 
                    guidance Gaia Eye would have never come to fruition.

            <h2><strong>Why Gaia Eye is part of the solution to the environmental's paradoxIf our unintentional actions got us into this environmental mess, then what could our intentional actions do?.</strong></h2>

            <p class="content">
                With Gaia Eye, we harness the same power that has desimated nature to now bolster it. We've
                taken our species to the bottom of the ocean, into space, and even on the moon. The burden of
                these advancements has come at the cost of the other life around us, and it's time to
                right the wrongs of our species. Through autonomous monitoring and analysis, we provide
                conversationists with vital information to best manage our natural world.
                We've come a long way from hunting mammoths and intermingling with Neanderthals. Our success has
                led to incredible feats of engineering and the depth of human knowledge a simple internet search away. Unbeknownst
                to us until recently, the environment and nature as a whole has taken the largest toll for our progress.
                Now, it's incumbant on us to design technologies that have come out of the industrial and technilogical revolutions
                that will not only take stock of what we have, but also build better autonmous systems forrestoration and conservation
                in the future.
