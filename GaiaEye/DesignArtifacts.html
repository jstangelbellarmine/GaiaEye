            <p>
                Juan is a 67-year-old site steward who has been managing ecological restoration projects for over 3 decades. 
                Every workday morning, he starts his day at 7 AM by contacting fire monitoring services to confirm site conditions. 
                With over 100 acres to manage, he carefully selects controlled burn sites and plants for restoration. 
                Using Gaia Eye, he maps out restoration efforts, prioritizes high-risk areas, and coordinates volunteer workdays. 

            </p>

            <h3><strong>Miguel Andres, Site Steward</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Miguel is a conservationist in his late 60s who supervises restoration sites for a the North Branch of the Cook County Forest Preserve. 
                He relies on Gaia Eye to monitor invasive species regrowth and ensure previous restoration efforts are effective. 
                By using drone-based imagery and AI-driven classification, he can assess large areas quickly and plan targeted removal operations. 
            </p>

            <h4><strong>Sara Sarkar</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Dr. Sara Sarkar is a professor specializing in machine learning applications in remote sensing. 
                She has researched the effectiveness of CNNs for ecological monitoring and recommended the use of YOLOv11 for Gaia Eye. 
                Her expertise helps refine the AI model, improving detection accuracy for invasive species. 
            </p>

            <h4><strong>Jose SanAngel, volunteer</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Jose is a passionate computer scientist in his mid-30s, leading the development of Gaia Eye. 
                He has taken a special interst in AI and applied machine learning, ensuring that the software remains efficient and scalable. 
                With a love for nature and technology, he is dedicated to creating a tool that empowers conservationists.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>Tomaso Wells, esteemed professor</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Tomaso is a university professor in his 30s who specializes in environmental science. 
                Though he prefers lab work over fieldwork, he recognizes Gaia Eye’s potential in conservation research. 
                He encourages his students to use the tool for real-world ecological studies.

            <h2><strong>John Balaban, Site Steward</strong></h2>
            <p>
                John starts his morning by calling fire monitoring services at 7 AM. He checks Gaia Eye to see which areas need attention, then plans the day’s restoration efforts.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Miguel Andres, Site Steward</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Miguel reviews the latest drone imagery from Gaia Eye. He identifies a high-risk area where invasive species have spread and marks it for a volunteer workday.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>Sara Sarkar, Researcher</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Sara uses Gaia Eye’s AI-generated reports to analyze the spread of invasive species. She refines the AI model to improve classification accuracy.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>Jose SanAngel, Developer</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Jose tests a new feature in Gaia Eye that improves drone image processing speed. After debugging, he pushes an update to the software.
