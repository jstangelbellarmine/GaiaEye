# GaiaEye

The  Gaia Eye Folder is for accessing my landing page, design artifacts, and GUI.

Gaia Eye Detector was too large to add here, so I am including the link to the notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11_BfDJO5h4ARdudzk6M8mnJdHlezxSli?usp=sharing

The other two notebooks, test/train and fotomapping are uploaded to the repository.
